# Conway's Game of Life â€“ Pygame Implementation

This project is a simple simulation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and the Pygame library.

->Description

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve across generations according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells.

-> Features

- Interactive cell toggling via mouse clicks
- Pause and resume the simulation
- Clear the board
- Generate random cell patterns

-> Controls

- Mouse Click: Toggle the state (alive/dead) of a cell
- Space Bar: Start or pause the simulation
- C Key: Clear the board and pause the simulation
- G Key: Generate a random pattern of alive cells

-> Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install the required library using:

```bash
pip install pygame
